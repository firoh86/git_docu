# Git documentation

This repo is about to translate the git documentation by BitBucket.

The purpose of this repo is cover all the basic and more advanced commands of git.
This gonna be made by translating with my own words the BitBucket documentation.
Also will be added a list of all commands at the end, with a short description sorted by in timeline commonly use.

[Go to the git guide](Git.md)
[View resources](resources.md)

Also the creation of this "guide" about git commands is being streamed in my own twitch channel, to share the process with some students that are interested in this documentation as well.
